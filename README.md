## :warning: Work in Progress

**A Library and CLI made in Haskell** (It's a project for fun and learn a lot)

Take a haskell code and generate an image.

You can test a telegram bot, which uses this library: https://t.me/PepeHsBot

##### Example with the CLI

file: `samples/code.hs`

```
module Main (main) where

import qualified Prelude as P (IO, ($), unwords, print)

-- | Hue hue Comment

main :: P.IO ()
main = do
  P.print P.$ P.unwords ["Hello", "Friend"]
```

```sh
$ cat samples/code.hs | ./result/bin/caani -o docs/code.png

   Yay!!! The image was saved in 'docs/code.png'

```

## Releases

It's needed to test the released binaries available [here](https://github.com/jeovazero/caani/releases). :see_no_evil:

## Building

With the [Nix](https://nixos.org/) installed:

```sh
$ make build
$ ./result/bin/caani -h
```

> I don't use Stack yet :(

## Roadmap
